## Project Overview

This is a **production-ready Smart Charter Party Generator** that automates the creation of Charter Party contracts by parsing recap documents and intelligently filling CP templates.

## Key Features Implemented

- **Document Processing**: Complete PDF, DOCX, and TXT parsing capabilities
- **NLP Engine**: Advanced text extraction with spaCy integration
- **Template Management**: Intelligent field detection and mapping
- **Generation Engine**: Automated CP creation with change tracking
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with comprehensive endpoints
- **Testing**: Full test suite with pytest
- **Deployment**: Docker configuration included

## Quick Start

```bash
# Quick start with the startup script
./start.sh

# Or manually
source .venv/bin/activate
python simple_app.py
